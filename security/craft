Trade Craft Notes:

 - Defenders:
   - Recommend admins set service accounts to a single failed login lockout policy
   - Disabling Seclogon (Secondary Logon) service prevents Make Token, Runas, etc..

 - Attackers:
   - Source for UserAgent Strings: http://www.irongeek.com/fed-watch.php
   - Customize PPID and Spawnto to look like legitimate processes
   - Run tasks as human accounts and not service account to blend in
   - Download Sysmon config to set PPID and Spawnto to something that will not be logged or will blend in
   - Don't make remote connections via IP because it will authenticate with NTLM vice Kerberose when using FQDN
   - Utilize secure delete when deleting artifacts on a target
   - When making a token always use the GUI as the command line can cause errors with special characters or spaces
   - Look for scheduled tasks that are missing exe's or contain script to utilize for persistence instead of creating new services or schtasks
   - Using Cobalts 'ls' command can lock out accounts. Recommend using 'dir'. Think they are using a custom C# dir
     - Make a tools list in C# for common Windows commands such as ipconfig, netstat, sc, etc..
