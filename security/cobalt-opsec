COBALT STRIKE OPSEC CONSIDERATIONS

API-only
These commands are built-into Beacon and rely on Win32 APIs to meet their objectives.

    ls
    make_token
    mkdir
    mv
    ppid

Post-Exploitation Jobs (Process Execution + Remote Process Injection)
Post-exploitation features spawn a process and inject a capability into that process. 

    browserpivot
    bypassuac
    covertvpn
    dcsync
    desktop
    elevate
    execute-assembly
    hashdump
    keylogger
    logonpasswords
    mimikatz
    net
    portscan
    powerpick
    psinject
    pth
    runasadmin
    screenshot
    shspawn
    spawn
    ssh
    ssh-key
    wdigest

OPSEC Advice: Use the spawnto command to change the process Beacon will launch for its post-exploitation jobs. The default is rundll32.exe 

Process Execution
These commands spawn a new process:

    execute
    runas
    runu

OPSEC Advice: The ppid command will change the parent process of commands run by execute. The ppid command does not affect runas or spawnu.

Process Execution: Cmd.exe
The shell command depends on cmd.exe.

The pth and getsystem commands rely on cmd.exe to pass a token to Beacon via a named pipe. 
The command pattern to pass this token is an indicator some host-based security products look for.

OPSEC Advice: The shell command uses the COMSPEC environment variable to find the preferred command-line interpreter on Windows. 
Use Aggressor Script’s &bsetenv function to point COMSPEC to a different cmd.exe location, if needed. Use the ppid command to change the parent process the command-line interpreter is run under. 
To pth without cmd.exe, execute the pth steps by hand. Don’t use getsystem. There are other ways to acquire a SYSTEM token.

Process Execution: PowerShell.exe
The following commands launch powershell.exe to perform some task on your behalf.

    elevate uac-token-duplication
    powershell
    spawnas
    spawnu
    winrm
    wmi

OPSEC Advice: Use the ppid command to change the parent process powershell.exe is run under. Be aware, there are alternatives to each of these commands that do not use powershell.exe:

The uac-token-duplication privilege escalation exploit has runasadmin. This command runs a command of your choosing with the same UAC bypass.
spawnu has runu which runs an arbitrary command under another process.
spawnas has runas which runs an arbitrary command as another user.
powershell has powerpick, this command runs powershell scripts without powershell.exe.
It’s also possible to laterally spread without the winrm and wmi commands.

Remote Process Injection
The post-exploitation job commands (previously mentioned) rely on process injection too. The other commands that inject into a remote process are:

    dllinject
    dllload
    inject
    shinject

Service Creation
The following internal Beacon commands create a service (either on the current host or a remote target) to run a command. These commands use Win32 APIs to create and manipulate services.

    getsystem
    psexec
    psexec_psh
